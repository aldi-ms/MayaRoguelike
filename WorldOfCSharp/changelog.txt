*Some work on Window.Write/WriteLine methods to update them. Write now uses a int
*for the vertical lines you move in the window, and WriteLine points to Write with
*a line count = 2, to eliminate code repetition.
*Implemented word wrap for Window.Write method. tbh copied and modified a block of
*code from MessageLog.SendMessage.
*Months after having the idea, finally! A way to print colored messages in the
*MessageLog. The method FormatWriteOnPosition, checks if there is a formatting
*sequence in the string passed according to coloredMessagesDesign.txt
*Introduced Race class.
===================================================================================
***06.08.2014***
*Re-made a new working implementation of Experience. Customisable by 
*const MAX_LEVEL, experienceModifier - multiplier of the experience gained.
*GainXP(double xp) is to be used for awarding the unit experience. If the experience
*goes over a treshhold (expPointsTable that is) the unit gains a level.
*Added xp level to sidebar info.
*Started optimizing the code for MessageLog. Slow printing/updating is the issue?
